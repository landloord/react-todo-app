# ReactParcelScss
#### Barebones React template with Parcel-bundler and SCSS/SASS support

# Rationale
In the words of [Dr. Angela Yu:](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/angela-yu-963a584b)
> Your tolerance decreases with experience

And so after an hour of frustration over constant failure in getting SCSS to work with the default webpack configuration that comes with `npx start-react-app appname` 
I decided to create one based off Parcel bundler.

## Usage
clone the repository inside of a preferred project directory (assuming you have already inatalled git and node)
`git clone https://github.com/landloord/ReactParcelScss.git`

You may want to rename the directory from **ReactParcelScss** into something esle (your project name). 
 cd into your newly renamed directory and execute 
`npm install` in the directory from a terminal to install athe required node modules.

## Updating
